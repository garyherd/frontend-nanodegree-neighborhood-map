# Neighborhood Map

This is Project #5 of the [Udacity Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001)

The goal of this project was to generate a single-page application featuring a map of my local neighborhood or a neighborhood you would like to visit.
The app uses the Google Maps Javascript API was to display map markers and their respective pop-up boxes, of a fixed set of locations.
The Foursquare API was also used to provide content to the pop-box when a user clicks on a marker.
